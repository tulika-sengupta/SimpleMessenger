# SimpleMessenger
In this application, we write a simple messenger app on Android. The goal of this app is simple: enabling two Android devices to send messages to each other.
We will need to run two AVDs in order to test the app.
There is only one text box on screen where a user of the device can write a text message to the other device.
The other device is able to display on screen what was received and vice versa.
Used the Java Socket API and all communication was be over TCP.
Assume that the size of a message never exceeds 128 bytes (characters).
